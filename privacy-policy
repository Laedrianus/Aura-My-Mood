**Effective Date: February 11, 2026**

Aura My Mood ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Aura My Mood mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### Camera and Image Data
Our application uses the camera to perform real-time mood analysis using on-device machine learning (ML Kit). 
- **Processing:** All facial analysis is performed locally on your device. 
- **Storage:** No images or facial data from the camera are ever sent to our servers or stored permanently by the application unless you explicitly save a result to your gallery.
- **Privacy:** We do not collect, store, or share biometric data.

### Local Storage
The app uses a local database (Room) to store your mood analysis history and preferences. This data remains on your device and is not synchronized with any cloud service.

## 2. Permissions
To provide its core features, the app requires the following permissions:
- **Camera:** To capture images for mood analysis.
- **Storage/Media:** To save generated mood analysis images to your device's gallery.
- **Internet:** To display advertisements and initialize core services.

## 3. Third-Party Services
We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:
- **Google Play Services**
- **AdMob:** We use AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use advertising IDs and other device-specific information to serve personalized ads. Please refer to [Google's Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 4. Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 5. Security of Data
The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your local data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
